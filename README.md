# Reflection Journal #

(still in progress)

A journaling app with daily reflection questions created using Ruby on Rails and Bootstrap. 

In my search for journaling websites, I discovered that many had features that could only
be unlocked by purchasing a premium membership. I decided to attempt to make my own app that would allow me to use these features for free. 

I added another form of journaling where the user only answers five simple questions a day that can be used to evaluate what to remember/improve on in the future. 


Features still in progress: 

* Home screen (users should only be able to access their personal journal after logging in)

* Image upload (users should be able to attach images to their entries if they want to) -- paperclip gem

* Calendar (integration with Google Calendar API)
