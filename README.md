# MyJournal #

A minimalistic journaling app created using Ruby on Rails and Bootstrap. 

In my search for journaling websites, I discovered that many had features that could only
be unlocked by purchasing a premium membership. I decided to attempt to make my own app that would allow me to use these features for free. 

Features still in progress: 

* Login functionality using devise

* Home screen (users should only be able to access their journal after logging in)

* Image upload (users should be able to attach images to their entries if they want to)

* Calendar (integration with Google Calendar API)

* Writing prompts

* Text editor tools (ie. different fonts, font size) for writing comfort
